# BusEye
🚍✨ Proud to Share Our SPM Course Project – "BusEYE"! ✨

We are excited to showcase BusEYE, our Smart Bus Tracking System developed as part of our Software Project Management (SPM) course. This project aims to improve public transport in urban areas by ensuring real-time visibility of buses for both passengers and conductors.

🔧 Key Features:

👤 Admin Panel – Admins can:
 
 ▪️ Add bus routes
 
 ▪️ Register conductors

 ▪️ Assign buses to routes

🧑‍✈️ Conductor Dashboard – Conductors can:
 
 ▪️Log in using their Bus ID
 
 ▪️ Start and end the ride
 
 ▪️ Update the current stop and available passenger capacity
 
 ▪️ Handle reversed routes with accurate stop tracking

🧍‍♂️ Passenger Interface – Passengers can:

 ▪️ Select a route
 
 ▪️ View all running buses on that route
 
 ▪️ Track current stop, and available seats in real-time



🌐 Built using the powerful MERN Stack:

React.js (Frontend)

Node.js + Express (Backend)

MongoDB (Database)

REST APIs for communication between services


🎥 In our demo, we walked through the full flow:

 1️⃣ Admin adding a route, a bus, and a conductor
 
 2️⃣ Conductor logging in and updating trip details
 
 3️⃣ Passenger tracking live updates for the selected route

This project reflects our understanding of software project planning, architecture, teamwork, and real-world user needs.
